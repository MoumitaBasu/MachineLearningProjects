# ðŸŽµ Lyrics Generator using LSTM

This project trains an LSTM neural network to generate song lyrics in the style of the training text.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Text preprocessing and sequence generation
- LSTM model built using Keras
- Custom training text (can be lyrics, poetry, etc.)
- Generate new text with seed input

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture
- Embedding Layer
- 2 LSTM Layers
- Dense Output with Softmax

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MoumitaBasu/MachineLearningProjects/tree/main/Lyrics%20Generator
   ```
2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. Place your training text in `data/lyrics.txt`
4. Run the notebook or script to train and generate text

## ðŸ›  Libraries Used
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
