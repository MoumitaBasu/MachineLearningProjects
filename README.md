# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my collection of hands-on machine learning projects! Each folder in this repository contains a standalone project with its own README, datasets, and code.

These projects cover a variety of topics in ML including healthcare, natural language processing, and generative deep learning.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MoumitaBasu/MachineLearningProjects.git
   ```
   ```bash
   cd MachineLearningProjects
   ```
3. Navigate into any project folder.
4. Follow the instructions in its README to run the code or train models.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NLP tools (nltk, TF-IDF, regex)
- Jupyter Notebooks

## 📚 Notes

- All datasets used are publicly available (linked inside each project's README).
- Each project demonstrates a full ML workflow: EDA → Preprocessing → Modeling → Evaluation.
- You can extend these projects by adding hyperparameter tuning, better visualizations, or deployment.
